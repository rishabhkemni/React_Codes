# React_Codes
Contains basic to advanced React codes and programs 

## Initial steps
1. Install create-react-app. Also you need Node.js installed on your machine beforehand 
   
   (Get the latest version of NodeJS from nodejs.org and install it on your machine.) 

2. To install create-react-app from the command line, run the following:

    **npm install -g create-react-app**
3. To create a React app (or site) with Create React App, we would run the following command in the command line:
    
   **npx create-react-app RK_project**
    
4. Node.js installed npx command to run the Node.js packages. The create-react-app argument tells npx to run the create-react-app package that creates new React projects. Third argument is test-project, which is the name of the project to create. When you run this command, the project will get created, and all the packages required for developing and running a React project will get downloaded and installed.

### Creating First Application
1. To create the test-project for this example, open command prompt, navigate to a convenient location, and run the command as shown below :
    
   **create-react-app test-project**
2. Now navigate to the project folder and add the React Responsive Carousel package to the project.

    **npm i react-responsive-carousel**

3. Now just replace the placeholder content of App.js with given App_carousel.js added in repo.

4. To run project got project directory/src and run **npm start App.js**

Similarly replace contents of **App.js,App.css,index.html,index.js and index.css** according to your convenience.
